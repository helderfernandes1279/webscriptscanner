This tool lets you quickly detect patterns of malicious code (most often obfuscated) written in javascript, detection is configurable via a signature file (yara.sig)

Besides the existing subscriptions is also possible to add more detection patterns by means of regular expressions and in line with the rules of Yara lib.

Files:

settings.conf -> this file contains the report's folder path(must be created)
webscriptscanner.py -> Main script
yara.sig -> signatures file (YARA)

ex:

webscriptscanner.py -u URL   -> scan the URL 

webscriptscanner.py -ip IP   -> scan's the URL's detected in the server
