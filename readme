This tool lets you quickly detect patterns of malicious code (most often obfuscated) written in javascript, detection is configurable via a signature file (yara.sig)

Besides the existing subscriptions is also possible to add more detection patterns by means of regular expressions and in line with the rules of Yara lib.

Files:

settings.conf -> this file contains the path of the scan reports (must be created)
webscriptscanner.py -> Main script
yara.sig -> signatures file (YARA)

ex:

webscriptscanner.py -u URL   -> scan the URL 

webscriptscanner.py -ip IP   -> scan's the URL's detected in the server 
 
webscriptscanner.py -u/-ip URL/IP -r   -> scan's the target and test if the HTTP GET is redirected when referer is set with google,yahoo,msn or BING search
